# Vinicius Hora

<sub>Software Developer at Evolve Tec</sub>

As a graduate in Economics from the prestigious Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets (IBMEC) and an experienced software developer, I have successfully merged two of my core strengths: problem analysis derived from my background in economics, and the practical implementation of solutions through software development. This unique combination enables me to approach data science projects with a holistic perspective.

To further enhance my skill set, I have delved into the world of Machine Learning, leveraging its power to augment decision-making processes. By incorporating ML techniques into my data-driven projects, I am able to extract valuable insights and unlock hidden patterns from complex datasets.

My academic journey at IBMEC provided me with a solid foundation in the financial domain, equipping me with the necessary knowledge to navigate and understand the intricacies of the market. Furthermore, the institute's emphasis on utilizing cutting-edge technologies, including ML, has fostered my ability to leverage advanced tools and algorithms to deliver innovative solutions.

With a strong background in Economics and a proficiency in software development, I am uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between data analysis and software engineering in the field of Data Science. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation, applying my multidisciplinary expertise to solve complex problems and drive impactful business outcomes.
